            Raigad Fort, perched atop the rugged Sahyadri range in Maharashtra, stands as a powerful testament to Maratha ambition and vision. Originally named Rairi, the hill fortress was captured and transformed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1656 into the capital of his Hindavi Swarajya. At an elevation of around 1,356 m above sea level and accessible via nearly 1,737 steps or a modern ropeway, the fort’s strategic position earned it the nickname “Gibraltar of the East” 
. Shivaji’s coronation as Chhatrapati in 1674 took place here under the rock-hewn Ganga Sagar tank, with ceremonies overseen by the sage Gagabhat 
. Inside, visitors can trace the ruins of royal quarters, a royal mint, the acoustically designed Naqqar Khana (drum house), watchtowers, the Jagadishwar Shiva temple, and the solemn samadhi of Shivaji 
. Harrowing historical sites like Takmak Tok—a cliff used for execution—stand alongside symbols of valor such as the Hirakani Bastion, built in honor of a courageous milkmaid who scaled its steep walls to reach her child 
. After Shivaji’s death, Raigad changed hands—from the Mughals to the British in 1818, who partially destroyed and plundered it—yet its legacy endured 
. Recent archaeological finds, including a 16th-century astrolabe, suggest scientific sophistication in its design 
. Today, Raigad is a revered heritage site, blending natural grandeur with a storied past that continues to captivate pilgrims, history enthusiasts, and trekkers alike.
