            Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi, is a major Hindu festival celebrated to mark the birth of Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity who is widely revered as the remover of obstacles and the god of wisdom and beginnings. The festival usually falls in the Hindu month of Bhadrapada (August–September) and lasts for 10 days, beginning on the Chaturthi (fourth day) of the waxing moon phase. During this time, beautifully crafted idols of Lord Ganesha are installed in homes and public places. Devotees perform daily prayers, aartis, and offer sweets like modaks, which are believed to be Ganesha’s favorite. On the final day, known as Anant Chaturdashi, the idols are taken in grand processions with music and dance for immersion in water bodies, symbolizing Ganesha’s return to his heavenly abode and the cycle of birth and rebirth. The festival is especially popular in Maharashtra, but it is celebrated with enthusiasm across many parts of India. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on eco-friendly practices to reduce environmental impact, such as using clay idols and natural colors. Ganesh Chaturthi is not only a religious festival but also a celebration of community, culture, and togetherness.

            On the first day (Gauri Avahan), women install beautifully decorated clay idols of Gauri—often two forms called Jyeshthā and Kaniṣṭhā—draped with sarees and ornaments. The idols are welcomed with chanting, devotional songs, rangoli, flower décor, and lighting of oil lamps, signifying Gauri’s auspicious entry into the household 
. Married women typically observe a fast and perform prayers invoking her blessings for marital bliss and the well‑being of their husbands 
.The second day (Gauri Puja) involves elaborate rituals and a grand feast (mahaprasad), with traditional offerings like puran poli, modak, and shrikhand, as well as a thali of 16 vegetables and other festive sweets. Women also engage in folk songs and perform traditional dances such as Phugdi and Zimma, celebrating togetherness and cultural heritage 
On the third day (Gauri Visarjan), the idols are carried in procession—often with singing and celebration—to a nearby river or tank for immersion. This ritual marks the goddess’s symbolic return to her divine abode and brings the festivities to a close
