            Modak is a traditional Indian sweet dumpling, particularly associated with Maharashtra but celebrated across India and many Southeast Asian countries 
. The outer shell is typically made from rice flour (or sometimes wheat), while the filling consists of freshly grated coconut and jaggery, often flavored with cardamom, nutmeg, or other spices 
. There are two main varieties: the steamed ukadiche modak, soft and served warm with ghee, and the crunchy fried modak, which lasts longest
. Deeply rooted in religious tradition, modak is revered as Lord Ganesha’s favorite sweet—known as modakapriya—and is also offered to Buddha, signifying spiritual bliss; during Ganesh Chaturthi, devotees often present 21 or 101 modaks as sacred prasad 
. Over time, both traditional and modern variants—such as mawa (khoya), chocolate, dry fruit, kesar, and even paneer modaks—have emerged, making this sweet dumpling a delightful blend of cultural heritage and evolving tastes
